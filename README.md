# Next Level Github Profile Readme

## Basic README.md

- customizing your github profile
  with a readme file is as simple as
  creating a repo that is named the same
  as your username

- if you wanna insert a point, just add "-" before
  your text
  e.g:

  ```
  - first point
  - second point
  ```

  result:

  - first point
  - second point

- if you wanna insert a link, you can do something like this:
  ```
  [myPorto]
  [myPorto]: https://portofolio-yehezkiel-wiradhika.herokuapp.com/
  ```
  result: [myPorto]

[myporto]: https://portofolio-yehezkiel-wiradhika.herokuapp.com/

- if you wanna insert a code:

  ````
  "```"
  some code here
  "```"
  ````

  note:
  don't include the ""

  result:

  ```
  some code here
  ```

- after all that, if you wanna push README.md
  to your github main profile, you're gonna have to
  push it to your username

- if you wanna add horizontal lines:
  ```
  ---
  ```
